Algorithm:
    1. Initialization: Initialize an array to represent the cats, with each element initialized to False, indicating no hat.
    2. Iteration: Iterate through each circle from 1 to the total number of circles.
        a. For each circle, iterate through the cats, starting from the (circle - 1)th cat, with a step of the circle size.
        b. Toggle the state of the cat's hat (True to False or False to True) based on its current state.
    3. Final Result: After all iterations, identify the cats that have hats on their heads and store their positions in a list.
    4. Return Result: Return the list of cats with hats.

Pseudo-code for the algorithm:
function get_cats_with_hats(array_of_cats):
    cats_with_hats_on = []

    for each circle from 1 to circles:
        for each cat in range(circle - 1, cats, circle):
            toggle_hat_state(array_of_cats[cat])

    for each cat in range(cats):
        if array_of_cats[cat]:
            cats_with_hats_on.append(cat + 1)

    return cats_with_hats_on

function toggle_hat_state(cat):
    if cat is False:
        cat = True
    else:
        cat = False


Complexity analysis:
    1. The outer loop runs 'circles' times.
    2. The inner loop runs 'cats' times in the worst case.
    3. The overall time complexity is O(circles * cats).
